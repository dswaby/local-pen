# Local-pen
#### boilerplate

Boilerplate for project with the intention to be put on codepen.io but developed locally. Includes my workflow defaults, less, haml, jquery, underscorejs, velocityjs and velocity ui

Requires you to have [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Haml](http://haml.info/). If you're on OS X or Linux you probably already have Ruby installed, try `ruby -v` in your terminal. When you've confirmed you have Ruby installed, run `gem install haml` to install Haml.

run `sudo npm install` from repo directory

run `grunt dev`
